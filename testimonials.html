                  surgery for the broken bone. After the shoulder healed, the
                  pain kept me up at nights even with the pain medications.
                  Thanks to Sunny's amazing technique, I am now able to sleep
                  and put my socks on my own. I am progressing much quicker than

                  chiropractors many times but the pain kept coming back again
                  and again. One of my friend referred to Dr. Kim. My pain
                  disappeared almost 80 % at first treatment. After 8 times of
                  treatment Dr. Kim recommended to take an x-ray to check the
                  scoliosis status. My back set straight and pain did not come
                  back again now for a year. I strongly recommend Dr. Kim if you
                  have back pain.</q

                  At that time Dr. Kim said, your body so cold and imbalanced.
                  I've got treated one time with herbal medicine. In a month
                  I've got baby, he is 4 years old now. Thank you again Dr.

                  caring acupuncturist in LA. Dr. has treated me for peripheral

                  symptoms were relieved after 1 session. Highly recommend

                  is knowledgeable about overall body/wellness and warm & caring

                  chronic IBS for nearly a decade, and her treatments have
                  drastically improved my overall condition, not to mention my
                  well-being! Dr. Kim has treated me for total-body wellness,
                  helped me understand how each piece of my health is woven
                  together, and guided me towards simple lifestyle changes I can
                  practice outside of acupuncture. She genuinely wants her
                  patients to heal and live happier, fuller lives. I can't
                  recommend her enough.</q

                  >I have been receiving accupuncture, cupping and chinese
                  medicine treatment for over ten years and I wholeheartedly
                  believe in it's healing properties. I encourage anyone to try
                  it. You will experience great relief in many instances
                  immediately and your level of relaxation and centeredness will
                  be markedly noticeable. Dr Sunny Kim is a gifted practitioner
                  and I enthusiastically recommend her. She is highly adept at
                  her skill and she does so with a gentle touch. What I
                  appreciate most about her is that she listens attentively. I
                  feel like she is able to better support and treat me in
                  relevant ways because she can integrate her own intuitive
                  approach by reading my body and pulses, along with what I
                  share I am experiencing. I also love that she will treat both
                  sides of my body and she does it so gracefully. In the past, I
                  have found Drs will only treat one side which left me feeling
                  incomplete. With Dr Kim, I feel like we have the opportunity
                  to treat various parts in one session and I am so grateful for
                  this. There is plenty of parking and her office is easy to
                  find right on Crenshaw. I do also appreciate the nice open
                  space that is her office and treatment rooms.</q

                  >All I can say is she is amazing. I get headaches, the kind
                  that are so painful its almost beyond impossible to bare. I go
                  and see Sun E, first of all she always makes time for me when
                  I need to see her, and she always takes the pain away.<br /><br />

                  I have tried many things for headaches, yoga, meditation,
                  chiropractors, physical therapy, and even other
                  acupuncturists, they all help but have never relieved the pain
                  as consistently as Sun E.<br /><br />

                  Just yesterday I went in with the Flu and a headache, I was
                  tired, cold and achy, I came out feeling clear headed, no
                  aches and pains, feeling warm and relaxed. Woke up this
                  morning and felt great.<br /><br />

                  She has a gift, I cannot explain how it works, but she gets
                  results like no other health provider I have ever been too,
                  without any medication, she is brilliant, exceptional and very
                  kind hearted too.<br /><br />

                  As a side note I rarely write reviews, but she is someone I
                  can completely stand behind and say whole heartedly I highly
                  recommend her.</q
