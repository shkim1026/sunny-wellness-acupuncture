                    Acupuncture is a medical practice that entails stimulating
                    certain points on the body, most often with a needle
                    penetrating the skin, to alleviate pain or to help treat
                    various health conditions.

                  <p>
                    Cupping therapy is a form of body work in which a therapist
                    puts special cups on your skin for a few minutes to create
                    suction. People use it to help with inflammation, blood
                    flow, relaxation and well-being, and as a type of
                    deep-tissue massage.
